# ms-office
Every now and again, you're trying to get something done, and you have a choice: do it manually or write a bunch of
throwaway code.  Over the years, I've found that MS Office - Excel most usually - can host throwaway code like that
extremely well while typically be much faster to develop.  This repo will contain some such things.

* **astronomical_objects_travel_times.xlsx** - this one isn't even code, it's just a spreadsheet with some (extremely)
simple formulas.  This came about when I got to wondering one day how long it would take to walk around the Sun
(ignoring reality, obviously), and then comaparing that to other astronomical bodies.  This spreadsheet provides
those answers!
